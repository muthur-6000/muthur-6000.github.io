# Matty Davis
**Systems Specialist | Hardware Forensic Analyst | Infrastructure Technologist**

> **"From component-level failure to enterprise-scale deployment."**

I am an IT professional specializing in the end-to-end lifecycle of enterprise technology. My work sits at the intersection of high-stakes hardware recovery, infrastructure engineering, and executive-level AV operations. I define my value not just by maintaining systems, but by rescuing high-value assets from "impossible" failure states and optimizing decommissioned hardware into functional, high-density infrastructure.

### 📖 The Engineering Mindset
Technology has never been a "black box" to me. My journey began with modding Source Engine code in middle school and has evolved into a career centered on understanding the "why" behind system failures. 

Whether it’s bypassing locked bootloaders on enterprise AR headsets or diagnosing a single failed MOSFET on a motor controller, I thrive in the space between standard software tools and the physical reality of hardware. I believe that a technician's greatest asset is the persistence to troubleshoot beyond the "click-to-fix" interface.

### 🛠️ Technical Competencies

#### **1. Hardware Forensics & Recovery**
* **Low-Level Recovery:** Expertise in bypassing corrupted firmware loops (Qualcomm HS-USB 9008/EDL mode) to rescue "bricked" enterprise assets like the HoloLens 2.
* **Component Diagnostics:** Proficient in multimeter-based circuit analysis, identifying semiconductor-level failures (MOSFETs/Capacitors), and performing cost-benefit analyses on component-level vs. board-level repairs.
* **Physical Bypasses:** Skilled in hardware-level administrative resets, utilizing motherboard jumpers (PWR REC) and NVRAM clearing to recover decommissioned server hardware.

#### **2. Systems Infrastructure & Asset Reclamation**
* **Server Architecture:** Managing the full lifecycle of **Cisco UCS** platforms, including **CIMC/BIOS** firmware synchronization and **RAID 5** storage array initialization.
* **Virtualization:** Deployment and optimization of **Proxmox VE** environments; specializing in high-performance hosting on repurposed USFF (Ultra-Small Form Factor) enterprise hardware.
* **Data Archival:** Engineering "zero-dependency" offline repositories (Kiwix) for disaster recovery, utilizing reclaimed SSD storage and multi-platform binary integration.

#### **3. Enterprise AV & UCC Operations**
* **UCC Ecosystems:** Full-stack management of **Microsoft Teams Rooms (MTR)** and **Yealink** systems, including firmware lifecycle management and peripheral troubleshooting.
* **AV Logic:** Maintaining **Q-SYS Ecosystems** and designer logic to ensure meeting room uptime and signal integrity.
* **Event Logistics:** Leading internal AV for corporate events; managing wireless frequency coordination and hybrid broadcasting environments.

#### **4. Identity & SaaS Administration**
* **Identity Management:** Managing complex user lifycicles via **Azure AD (Entra ID)** and **Active Directory (ADUC)**.
* **Security Operations:** Facilitating **Microsoft Authenticator** MFA enrollment and utilizing **Microsoft Defender** for endpoint threat mitigation.
* **Remote Connectivity:** Troubleshooting **Palo Alto GlobalProtect VPN** to ensure secure remote access for hybrid workforces.

#### **5. Technical Communications & Design**
* **Documentation:** Authoring technical SOPs and forensic-style project documentation (as seen in this portfolio) to bridge the gap between complex engineering and stakeholder understanding.
* **Visual Strategy:** Utilizing **Adobe Creative Cloud** to design end-user adoption materials and professional digital signage.
