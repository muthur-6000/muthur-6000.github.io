# Matty Davis
**Systems Specialist | Hardware Forensic Analyst | Infrastructure Technologist**

> **"If it has an IP address, I manage it."**

I am an IT professional specializing in the end-to-end lifecycle of enterprise technology. My work sits at the intersection of high-stakes hardware recovery, infrastructure engineering, and executive-level AV operations. I define my value not just by maintaining systems, but by rescuing high-value assets from "impossible" failure states and optimizing decommissioned hardware into functional, high-density infrastructure.

### 💾 System Lore & The Engineering Mindset

If you are wondering about the `muthur-6000` handle, it is a direct nod to the 1979 sci-fi horror classic, *Alien*. On board the commercial towing vehicle *Nostromo*, MU/TH/UR 6000 (affectionately called "Mother") was the central mainframe. She was the silent, unseen architect keeping the ship flying, the life support running, and the payload secure while the crew slept.

As an IT Systems Specialist, that is exactly how I view enterprise infrastructure: the best IT environments are the ones you do not even realize are operating until you need them.

This mindset is rooted in my history. Born in 1998, I grew up right on the bleeding edge of the unfiltered, wild-west internet. Technology was a lifelong obsession that started in kindergarten with cereal box CD-ROMs, and by middle school, it evolved into modding Source Engine server code using C++ and Lua. Breaking software just to see how it worked fostered a love for hands-on, hardware-level problem-solving that goes far beyond standard software support. 

Today, I thrive in the space between standard software tools and the physical reality of hardware. I believe a technician's greatest asset is the persistence to troubleshoot beyond the "click-to-fix" interface. Whether I am orchestrating a nationwide iPad deployment, reviving a shattered Lenovo ThinkPad with a complex motherboard swap, or spinning up Proxmox containers on my home Cisco UCS server, I approach the work with a focus on absolute structural efficiency. 

This lifelong obsession translates to a deep appreciation for "cassette futurism" and industrial-grade tech (and yes, my custom Linux desktop environments are usually themed after Aperture Science). Outside the server room, I maintain a constant curiosity for art, history, and geopolitics, believing that a well-rounded perspective is what allows a technician to become a true problem solver.

Ultimately, `muthur-6000` represents the intersection of my professional governance and my personal passions: maintaining order in the void, protecting the payload, and ensuring the mainframe serves the crew flawlessly.
